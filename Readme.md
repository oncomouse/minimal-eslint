# Minimal ESLint Project

For projects that don't use something like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), I want a quick template to get started with [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint). This uses `eslint:recommended` and [`babel-eslint`](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint), but has no JSX or Flow support.
